# Cavity-Classification
The project extensively uses Python libraries like Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for tasks ranging from data preprocessing to model training and visualization.

The project starts with data exploration, where Seaborn and Matplotlib are used to visualize images and extract descriptive statistics such as mean, variance, and skewness. Pseudocolor schemes and histograms are employed to analyze image data in detail. The images are then converted into grayscale for further analysis, and binary thresholding is applied to distinguish between caries and non-caries images.

Data augmentation techniques such as translation, rotation, scaling, and affine transformations are implemented using OpenCV to enhance the dataset and improve model generalization. These transformations involve shifting images, rotating them at different angles, resizing, and altering perspectives.
